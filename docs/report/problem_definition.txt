In this project, we want to create a locale planning system, which supports the user in the manual task of booking one or more rooms at one or more time-spans. The main problem, is the difficulty in presenting the data for the user, without knowing exactly what problem the user wants to solve, as there is infinitely many ways to book rooms.
As a concrete example, as a limitation of the scope, we'll develop the system for the IT-University.

During the project, we will:

- Develop and create a room management system, with a user friendly graphical user interface which presents the possible solutions for the user, and the underlying datastructures.

- Analyze the needs and requirements for such a system. Conduct a (rather limited, but structured) domain analysis, to determine the current practice of room allocation and management.

- Carry out several usability tests on various mockups and prototypes of the GUI.

- Implement the system on a webserver, to make it accessible through a browser.

- Apply the multi-paradigm, and statically typed programming language 	scala to implement the system, and make use of a web-framework for 	scala called lift. 

- Discuss alternative tools for implementation, and why we have chosen as we did.
