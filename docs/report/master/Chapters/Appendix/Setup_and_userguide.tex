\subsection{Setup and requirements}
We have developed the application in a local environment, making it possible to run the program on any computer with the right setup. The server has been tested running on a Mac with OS X Snow Leopard / Lion and Windows 7 Pro 32bit. The client has been tested in Chrome version 11 and 12, but there should be no complications using any Webkit based browser.
