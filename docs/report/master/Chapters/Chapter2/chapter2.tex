% Læs søren la om Requirements
Since the ITU does not currently have a full system, we have put up initial requirements for such a system.
As described in the target audience \todo{ ref}, the system will be used by a wide variety of people, and there will be virtually no way to train them, thus putting a very high bar for user-friendliness. We have met this problem head-on by writing up all the tasks our system must support, along with quality requirements describing to what level our users must have succesfull uses. \cite{lauesen}

\todo{This section should conclude with a initial list of required tasks}
